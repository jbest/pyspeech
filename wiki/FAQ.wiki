* How do I make speech recognition not suck? *

Microsoft's Speech Recognition is awful at first, especially when not listening for a short list of phrases.  Be sure to train it: Start Menu -> Settings -> Control Panel -> Speech -> Train Profile.

* Why shouldn't I use PyTTS instead? *

[http://www.cs.unc.edu/Research/assist/doc/pytts/ PyTTS] provides text-to-speech service, not speech recognition service.  However, it gives you much more control over the voice (pitch, speed, etc) -- speech.py just uses the default Windows voice as a convenience in case you need something spoken.  If you need speech recognition and also precise control of the computer's voice, use both modules.
